    <p>For the phrase "slipped by", I drew a photo of the grim reaper to symbolize the stealthy nature of death.  The monster in Frankenstein for example strangled William in the night and did it quickly and stealthily so he would not get caught.  Frankenstein's monster brought death upon others.  The thing that “slipped by” in the poem I believe is a dark thought that is hiding in the shadows and waiting for the right moment to strike. It instills fear and uneasiness throughout the poem and also hints at death.</p>
