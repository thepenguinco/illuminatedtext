    <p>In our selected excerpt, Eliot compares the character of Alfred Prufrock to a cat, secluded and hard to socialize with others. The cat wanders around at night - trying to find the house where it thinks it belongs. This is similar to what occurred in the haunting where Eleanor - who was rejected by her sister - travelled alone to the Hill House. The Hill House had a special allure of Eleanor and voices inside her head told her this is where she belonged. Indeed, the Hill House took her life at the end and was her final resting place. The similarity of seclusion and a sense of dread is further exemplified by a quote at the very beginning of the film: “whatever walked there, walked alone.”
    The Hill House preys on its victim at night, like how a lonely stray cat wanders the streets with its swift and sneaky movements.</p>
