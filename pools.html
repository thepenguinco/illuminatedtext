    <p>The pools mentioned in the poem do not represent clean pools full of water.  The “pools that stand in drains” are emptied and no longer contain any water .  The dirt in the pool shows that it is no longer pure, perhaps after cleansing him of his struggles and contributes to the unnerving feeling produced by the poem.  This could show that the main character in the poem is struggling with something internally, a characteristic of the modern hero. In <strong>The Swimmer</strong>, the pools were also portrayed as a cleansing agent to help purify someone as it gave Neddy Merril strength whenever he swam in the pool.  The empty pool represents the loss of this purifying agent and the loss of internal strength.</p>
