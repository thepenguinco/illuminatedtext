    <p>The “yellow smoke” that muzzled the window-pane seem to describe Prufrock’s mind - clouded and paralyzes - unable to think. It also contributes to a dreary but mysterious mood. In Frankenstein, smoke surrounds Victor’s passage to Mont Blanc. It clouds Victor’s mind, until he had reached the top where he could see everything clearly. In the song that I chose, the artist sings of loneliness and thoughtfulness as he blows smoke rings in the dark, which relates to both works.</p>
