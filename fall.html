    <h1>Poem:</h1>
    <p>Night falls upon the innocent souls,<br>
    Morbid silence hangs in the midnight air,<br>
    Trapped in a place of eternal woes,<br>
    Wondered foolishly into a tigerâ€™s lair.<br>
    Relentless pounding on the door,<br>
    Like the beating of the heart,<br>
    Doomed to repeat the stories of before,<br>
    Enter, here, reality and life slowly departs.<br>
    Watch them fall, one by one,<br>
    Feast upon them, on and on.<p>

    <p>Everything that walks here,<br>
    Walks alone,<br>
    The house is alive,<br>
    Whispering aching groans.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The street that Prufrock walks on is unpleasant, with soot falling from chimneys of houses. It creates an unsettling and confused atmosphere. This is similar to what occurred in the haunting, with the house preying on women and almost lure Eleanor to fall from the house to her death.
      My poem aims to recreate a sense of dread and unsettledness that I felt from the poem and the Haunting of Hill House. It relates to the unpleasantness due to the soot falling from chimneys to the horrifying past of Hill House.</p>
