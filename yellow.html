    <h1>Lurking About</h1>
    <p>Where the yellow wallpaper sat
    <br>Where the walls and ceilings lay flat</p>
    <p>Pinned up with a rusty old nail
    <br>The colour and odour were stale</p>
    <p>Shrouded in fog
    <br>Thicker than smog</p>
    <p>And behind it all
    <br>Was a monster tall</p>
    <p>Lurking in the shadows</p>

    <p>The colour yellow symbolizes something important in both the poem and the yellow wallpaper.  I interpreted the yellow fog as a method of concealment in the poem. It was used to conceal the true thoughts of the main narrator.  The fog “rubs its back upon the window-panes” and hides whatever is behind the windows.  In the yellow wallpaper, it acted to conceal something sinister that Jane, the narrator saw inside the yellow wallpaper.  There is something unnerving about the colour yellow, especially when it is accompanied by a musty smell since it could be reminiscent of something completely disgusting and horrifying.  My poem attempts to describe the foul nature of the colour yellow and what is hiding behind the thick yellow fog and yellow wallpaper.</p>
