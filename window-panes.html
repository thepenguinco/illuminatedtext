    <p>I interpreted “window-panes” as being the mind of Prufrock and it is being clouded by smoke and fog. I think this relates back to The Swimmer, where Ned Merrill peeked into the windows of different houses, including his own. Everytime he does that, he seems to know more about what he had forgotten about himself - his economic and social failures. In other words, gazing through the windows can be seen as his mind starting to remember his past to see what he was and what he has become. In my drawing, the man stood frozen in front of a dirty window-pane. Wiping off of the dust on the window, he starts to stare at his own reflection to see a man with a frown and grows pensive as to where the future lies.</p>
